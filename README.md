#Vagrant Basebox Repository

This repository holds files that I've created to facilitate DIY 
Vagrant base boxes.  I'm currently focusing on centos 6 and 7.

* scripts - contains my box_prep.sh script and the default vagrant ssh key file.

Combined into a single machine_define.yml::
* centos6 - contains a Vagrantfile and machine_define.yaml file.
* centos7 - contains a Vagrantfile and machine_define.yaml file.

What I'm working on:
* Creating a DIY base box that may be updated and added to my NAS web server.
